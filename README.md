👋 Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio—where React code meets questionable life choices and way too much coffee.
🚀 Explore my projects (they work, I promise), marvel at my skills, and scroll through a gallery that’s almost as good as my mom says it is.
💌 Want to chat? My contact form is always open—send me a message and I’ll reply faster than you can say “console.log(‘Hello World!’)”.

Enjoy your stay, and don’t forget to star the repo if you laughed (or even if you didn’t)!
